QR Code Reader

As part of the image processing assignment of CompSci 373 in Semester 1, 2021. 

This assignment required what we have studied in the image processing lectures to generate a software that detects QR codes in images - a technology that we are using daily when scanning QR codes with the COVID19 tracer app.

matplotlib is a required python libary to run this code.
