QR Code Reader

This repository provides a Python 3 code skeleton for the image processing assignment of CompSci 373 in Semester 1, 2021. 

This assignment will require you to use what we have studied in the image processing lectures to generate a software that detects QR codes in images - a technology that we are using daily when scanning QR codes with the COVID19 tracer app.

matplotlib is a required python libary to run this code.
